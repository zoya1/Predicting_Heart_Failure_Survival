# Predicting Heart Failure Survival

### Problem Definition

Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure, occurs when our heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Its  one of the leading cause of death globally, taking estimated 17 million lives each year. Certain conditions, such as narrowed arteries in our heart (coronary artery disease) or high blood pressure, gradually leave your heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump efficiently.

Not all conditions that lead to heart failure can be reversed, but treatments if started in time, can improve the signs and symptoms of heart failure and help us live longer. Lifestyle changes — such as exercising, reducing sodium in your diet, managing stress and losing weight — can improve our quality of life.

Dataset of 299 patients with heart failure was chosen for this study. Machine Learning classifiers were applied to predict patient survival and rank the features corresponding to the most important risk factors.
